# final_proj_check
Step 1, run the program “final_proj_3.py” on the console, and then he/she would see a Flask page with scent choices. 

Step 2, the user chooses a scent type from all the scents and submit the form in Flask. 

Step 3, four bar graphs will be presented in ployly in the file “result_file.html”

The user could repeat Step 2 and Step 3 on Flask and choose the scent type repeatedly on Flask to see results of different scents.

Required Python packages for my project to work: 
requests, flask, plotly, sqlite3, bs4, numpy

The user doesn't need to run the files “final_proj_1.py” and “final_proj_2.py” since they are used for scraping pages and building database respectively.
